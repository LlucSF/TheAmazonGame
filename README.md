## Installation
In order to play the game you just need to run the __main__ script, but first you need the packages included in the requirements.txt file.
I recommend creating a new venv and installing there the packages:
```
# Create a new venv using conda
$ conda create -n amazons_env python=3.7

# Activate it
$ conda activate amazons_env

# Install from requirements.txt
(amazons_env)$ pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt
```
If you want to install the packages manually, just installing pygame and networkx should be fine.
